[> Blender Smooth Slides:

Blender is an incredible and polymorphic tool to create and prototype.
This script/tool combines the game engine embedded inside Blender and the Open Document Presentation 
standard to make your presentation sexier and smoother !

The idea of this tool is to convert an ODP file into Blender "ready-to-run" Game Engine file with provided 
templates with preloaded animations and transitions.

[> Install:

The script is run with the following commands :
blender -b <template> -P odp_importer.py -- <odp file>

parameters:
<template> is the blender template with preloaded animations and transitions
<odp file> is the presentation file you want to convert

The script will result in a new Blender file named like the presentation file.

[> Changelog :
    v0.1 :
        - Dirty proof of concept :P

[> TODO
    Write more documentation (indeed).
    Add sort of option to use images to display texts instead of Text3D.
    Add more interactive stuff inside templates (clickable images, animated models ...).
